About Us
========

We are the engineering division of PT. Gramedia Digital Nusantara.  Currently
numbering about 50 engineers covering:

* Web Development (JavaScript, Python, PHP)
* Native Mobile Development (iOS and Android)
* Windows Apps (Even today, sometimes desktop is the right tool!)
* Business Intelligence Developers (Power BI)
* Data Engineering
* Quality Assurance Engineering
* I.T. Operations (DevOps, SRE, Systems Engineers.. whatever you like to call it)

As you may have guessed from the name, although we are closely associated with (hopefully) your
favorite nation-wide book retailer (PT Gramedia Asri Media), we are a separate company and focus
more on the digital transformation and omni-channel aspects of the ever-changing retail business.
That also means that we are a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
`Kompas Gramedia <https://www.kompasgramedia.com/>`_,  located in  in Kompas Tower in Palmerah.

At GDN we make and support:

* The most popular e-reading app in Indonesia with over a million users on iOS and Android (Gramedia Digital, formerally SCOOP).
* The e-commerce site and apps for omni-channel fulfillment
* Specialized Educational and Business Internal variants of 
* The site and infrastructure powering omni-channel shopping at the largest book retailer in Indonesia
    * (Also, bragging rights--our site is the largest among traditional retailers in Indonesia).

Philosophy and Culture
----------------------

We try our best to follow the principals of Agile Development
and release quickly and in small pieces.

The majority of our teams release software multiple times a week.

Testing and automation are also core tenants at Gramedia.  We always
want to ensure that we're not repeating the work and we're able to
safely release new features as soon as possible.

We look for the following when hiring into our teams:

The most important criteria is that everyone brought into
our teams are someone that our teams **want** to work with.

Building any non-trivial software is not a solo activity and
the stereotype of the solo-engineer who is so smart that
they don't need anyone else is a lie.

*If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far
you go together.*

What we build with
------------------

Mobile
^^^^^^

Our mobile teams are invested in building with the platform-native technologies,
and generally stay away from things like React Native, Phone Gap and Flutter.

Web
^^^

Although we do have some large applications (powering several billion worth
of transactions monthly) on PHP and Code Igniter, the majority of our applications
are built with Python.. and most of those on Flask and Django.

For frontends, some are built with server side templating (either in Jinja or PHP),
however for our heavily trafficed sites (like gramedia.com), we are currently using
the Angular5 framework.

Beyond that, we also have the odd script or two floating around that runs NodeJS.

Desktop
^^^^^^^

We're part of a large enterprise and for certian applications (like fulfillment
systems running in a warehouse) Windows-based enterprise applications are the
sometimes the right tool for the job.  For those, we use C# and WPF or UWP.

Data
^^^^

OLTP mostly in PostgreSQL.  Our data engineering team uses a mix of Python (Bonobo and Luigi) 
and still quite a bit of Pentaho for ETL processing.

Our BI developers live in the microsoft world of Power BI to build the dashboards to help
business make the right decisions quickly.

We utilize Amazon's Redshift product for our data warehousing.
